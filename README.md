# About Trek2There™

![App](./thumbnail.png)

Trek2There™ is a mobile app that gets your field workforce to any off-road location, where no trails or paths exist.

Position yourself, locate things, and confidently get in and get out. Save time by getting there faster, and then find your way home safely.

Trek2There™ provides two simple pieces of continuously updated information: the direction you need to travel, and a distance remaining to get there.
